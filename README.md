For this challenge, we are tasked to (1) do a data analysis of the Hawaii weather stations data and (2) to design a Flask API Climate app that would help in planning our upcoming holiday vacation.
The first part of the challenge required us to access a sqlite database of the climate data and to run SQLAlchemy ORM queries to do data analysis and plot the results using Pandas and Matplotlib.
The second part of the challenge made use of Flask API to design a Climate App that shows results of different climate analysis queries.
